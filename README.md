# The New React

## The New React workshop at DevDays Vilnius 2019

The React team rewrote the book on developing components. Before we had a choice between classes and functional components. Yet many components needed to be classes. A functional component was often too limited. Now, using hooks, we can extend functional components to be as powerful as we want.

Join Maurice in this interactive workshop -you will learn all about using the different standard hooks. You will start extracting code from components into you own custom hooks. But be warned, hooks are like a drug. Once tried you too will be hooked. Your components will never be the same again.

## Agenda
### Part 1: Introducing React Hooks presentation:
- What are hooks?
- What problem do hooks solve?
- What are some of the tradeoffs with hooks?
### Part 2: Using the basic React hooks
- Start with your first stateful hook.
- Handle asynchronous side effects with the useEffect hook
- Use the useContext hook to make context easy.
- Create your own custom hooks
### Part 3: Using the more advanced hooks
### Part 4: Concurrent React
- Use lazy() to automatically bundle split and lazy load parts of your application
- Add strict mode to ensure your React components will work with concurrent React
- Use concurrent rendering with ReactDOM
- Leverage React cache to make async loading of data even easier

## Objectives
The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the future way of coding React components and applications.

## Target audience
The target audience is every React developer interested in the future of component development with React hooks as well as concurrent rendering with React.

## Requirements
### Installation
- A laptop with Node 8 and NPM 8 or later and your favorite code editor installed on it.
